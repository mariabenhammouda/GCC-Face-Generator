# GCC-Face-Generator

The human face and its features represent the most intuitive and personal aspect of individuals. Its uniqueness underscores the value of extracting features and information, termed soft biometrics, which greatly enhances recognition performance and refines search algorithms for facial images. While these advancements offer promising applications across various domains such as law enforcement, surveillance, advertising, and social media profiling, a critical gap emerged upon reviewing existing literature. More specifically, there is a notable absence of representation of the Arab world, and when present, it tends to be unfairly represented. Moreover, the current face generators available in the market fall short of accurately generating specific subgroups within the Arab population, such as Levantine, Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), Egyptian, and North African individuals.

Below are three images generated using different AI text-to-image face generators, highlighting evident misrepresentation. These images frequently depict stereotypes and Arab tropes, including black beards, head wraps, and stereotypical "Arabian" clothing:
